The spill was caused by a manual drain valve on an unstabilized condensate tank to remain open, overfilling the produced water sump and filling up the secondary containment of the sump. The manual drain valve was opened to drain water from the vessel, a process that occurs a number of times during the day. However, the operator was called away from the process and did not return to the valve until much later, resulting in the overfill of the sump. Upon discovery of the spill the DCP Operator shut the valve on the condensate vessel and contacted the Facility Supervisor to begin the process of cleaning up the condensate spill. A vacuum truck was called in to remove and dispose of the condensate within the secondary containment and sump. Further remediation of the secondary containment as well as the surrounding is planned and will begin as soon as possible.", "date": "11\/3\/2015" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -104.72973, 40.36378 ] } },
